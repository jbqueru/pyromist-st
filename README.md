I am Djaybee from the MegaBuSTers

This is an attempt at building an Atari ST demoscreen in 2020, after
almost 25 years of not writing any such code.

Since I don't have access to actual hardware, this is being developed
on Hatari (currently v2.1.0) with EmuTOS (0.9.12, 192k US), using
RMAC as the assembler.
